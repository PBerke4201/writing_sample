Hello, the following repository contains my Python writing sample, taken from the final project for my General Assembly Python Coding Short Course. 
The assignment itself was completed using Kaggle, a link to which can be found below (it may be easier to review the code there).

The assignment itself involved selecting a publically available dataset from Kaggles library and using our knowedlge of Python and datasets to clean, filter, and sort
the selected data and try and showcase intereting information able to be gleamed. This involved using plots, basic statistics, and sorting and filtering to make our findings.
For my project, I selected a dataset of the current Pokemon Pokedex, which included information on all the released Pokemon from generations 1 to 8.
